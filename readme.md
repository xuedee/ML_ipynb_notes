Here we demonstrate how to use ensemble methods such as Scikit-learn's RandomForestRegressor, HistGradientBoostingRegressor and AdaBoostRegressor, as well as xgboost.

For this example we will use the California Housing Prices dataset available here:

We then show hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV and Optuna.
